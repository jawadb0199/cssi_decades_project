    <h1>The Top Scientific Discoveries in the 2000s</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>2001- Along with the famous iPod invented by Apple Inc. in the year 2001, another remarkable invention of this year was the bio-artificial liver.
        <br>Dr. Kenneth Matsumura and Alin Foundation invented the artificial liver by designing a device that utilizes animal liver cells.
        <br> Instead of sticking with the age-old idea of using mechanical devices used to replace organs, this breakthrough technology included a mechanical device as well as biological elements.
        <br> The animal cells are trapped behind a membrane (thin parting inside) in the bio-artificial liver.
        <br>Therefore, while the cells can perform all the common functions of the liver such as filtering the blood, and eliminating toxins,
        <br> the cells do not merge with human blood causing no reactions or harm to the person. </li>

      <li>2008- The scientific and medical miracle for the year 2008 was the personal retail DNA testing kit.
        <br> Through a saliva test the DNA kit can estimate your genetic links to more than 90 hereditary traits ranging from baldness to chronic diseases.
        <br>Although the kit was not invented in the year 2007, it was released publicly to the common consumers.
        <br>Human genotyping has been available to every person rather than just the executive order thanks to the inventors 23andMe.
        <br> Consider the possible benefits and consequences of such an invention that can track your chances of being in a specific state, or medical condition based on your genes and not just social, environmental and purely technological factor. </li>

      <li>2009- The Sixth Sense developed in the year 2009 by Pranav Mistry at the MIT media lab USA is a wearable gestural interface turning all actions into digital information capable of being processed in any technologically advanced device, such as a computer, mobile, etc.
        <br> It has been the fundamental technology of digital effects in sci-fi movies for almost a whole decade.
        <br> The Sixth Sense consists of a pocket size projector and a camera connected to a portable computing device.
        <br> The camera identifies the hand gestures and movements of the user while the projector can use surfaces to display visual data and let them be used as computer interfaces.
        <br> The device uses the video streaming from the camera and processes it with the software in synchronization with the visual tracking referencing sensors that the user wears at his fingertips. </li>

      <li>2006 - Year 2006 was slightly slow-paced in the field of scientific inventions.
        <br> Although a lot of prototypes and beta-testers were released, only a few actual products were seen in the markets.
        <br> One of these products was the Loc8tor. Loc8tor attaches radio frequency emitting tags to all your small possessions that you forgetfully misplace the most.
        <br> It points in the right direction, left and right, and up and down too, bringing you as close as an inch from the item.
        <br> The tag does its part and beeps to pinpoint the exact location too. </li>

      <li>2005- The most popular and successful invention in the year 2005 was YouTube.
        <br> The website which achieved the greatest consumer response is a video-hosting website that lets users share videos across the globe.
        <br> The website invented by Jawed Karim, Steve Chen and Chad Hurley is currently one of the most famous websites in the world! </li>
